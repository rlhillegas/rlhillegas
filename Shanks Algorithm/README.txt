The purpose of this program is to apply Shank's babystep-giantstep method to solve descrete
logrithm problems.  For a problem g^x = h in F(p), define g, h, and p in the "main" method.
the output will be solution for x.  The program takes advantage of Java's built in
BigInteger package to mitigate integer overflow issues.
