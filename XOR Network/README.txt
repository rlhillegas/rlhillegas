The purpose of this program is to learn XOR logic using an MLP.  The network uses a 2, 3, 1 layer design,
a Binary Cross Entropy loss function, and the Adam optimization algorithm.  It typically learns the inputs
in 15000 epochs with a BCE error of < 0.01.

To run the code, you will need Python 3.6 or greater and PyTorch.  You can run the code using the following
command:

	python3 xor_net.py
