The purpose of this program is to solve simultaneous systems of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
Instructions for defining a list of congruencies are shown in the code.

To run the program, you will need to have JDK installed.  Follow these steps:

	1. run "javac CRT.java" to compile the code.
	2. run "java CRT" to run the program.

Here is an example output:
x = 37 (mod 43)
x = 22 (mod 49)
x = 18 (mod 71)
